<p>The tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the lion, leopard and jaguar, all of which are classified under the genus <em>Panthera</em>. Genetic analysis indicates that the tiger and the snow leopard diverged from the other <em>Panthera</em> species about 2.88 million years ago, and that both species may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar.</p>

<p>The oldest remains of an extinct tiger relative, called <em>Panthera zdanskyi</em>  or the Longdan tiger, have been found in the Gansu province of northwestern China. This species is considered to be a sister taxon to the extant tiger and lived about 2 million years ago, at the beginning of the Pleistocene. It was smaller than the modern tiger, being the size of a jaguar, and probably did not have the same coat pattern. Despite being considered more "primitive", the Longdan tiger was functionally and possibly ecologically similar to its modern cousin. As <em>Panthera zdanskyi</em> lived in northwestern China, that may have been where the tiger lineage originated. Tigers grew in size, possibly in response to adaptive radiations of prey species like deer and bovids which may have occurred in Southeast Asia during the early Pleistocene.</p>

<p>The earliest fossils of true tigers are from Java, and are between 1.6 and 1.8 million years old. Distinct fossils are known from the early and middle Pleistocene deposits in China and Sumatra. A subspecies called the Trinil tiger (<em>Panthera tigris trinilensis</em>) lived about 1.2 million years ago and is known from fossils found at Trinil in Java.</p>
