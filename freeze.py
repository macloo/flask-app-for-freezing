When you run this file in the Terminal, it creates a static version of your Flask app in a folder named 'build.' You can upload this folder to your web server and run it without WSGI. Make sure you installed Frozen-Flask in your virtualenv before trying this. Note that it creates STATIC pages, so some types of Python interaction (such as forms) would not work.

More details ...
Frozen-Flask can be configured using Flaskâ€™s configuration system. The following configuration values are accepted:

FREEZER_RELATIVE_URLS
If set to True, Frozen-Flask will patch the Jinja environment so that url_for() returns relative URLs. Defaults to False. Python code is not affected unless you use relative_url_for() explicitly. This enables the frozen site to be browsed without a web server (opening the files directly in a browser) but appends a visible index.html to URLs that would otherwise end with /.
